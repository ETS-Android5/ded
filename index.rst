ABOUT COOKBOOKS
---------------

The following documentation outlines the entire CCADI Cookbook workflow.
This includes versioning, hierarchy, storage, and formatting for all
Cookbooks created for the CCADI project.

Cookbook definition: A better cookbook would be detailed technical
snippets that show how to use the API (already shown in the
documentation) but to do so in a very applied technical context, like
how to set up a visualization in R that consumes JSON-LD from the API.
This adds an additional way to build custom functionality that is not
typically covered in a general README.

READ THE DOCS

ReadTheDocs host our docs for the web, but they are also viewable as
PDFs, as single page HTML, and for eReaders. Whenever the documentation
has pushed code through our GitLab - CCADI Public Repository,
Readthedocs will automatically build the docs so the documentation are
never out of sync.
